# 802.11S-2.4ghz-PiMesh
RPi mesh network on 2.4ghz

During the work to get the Teledatics TD-XPAH sub-ghz adapters I ran some testing to troubleshoot the commands used to create a mesh network.

As mentioned before I am no networking guy so this took a few attempts. Figured I'd leave this here in case someone else may find it useful. This is pretty bare bones and doesn't have any interfaces bridged to the mesh point. but should be a decent starting point. This was done using Alfa AWUS036ACM adapters on pi 4's running raspbian bookworm
